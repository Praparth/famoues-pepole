        India's populist prime minister remains hugely popular in the second most populous country on earth, with a population of 1.3 billion people.
            <br>
        In November 2016 he unexpectedly announced plans to eliminate India's two largest banknotes in a bid to reduce money laundering and corruption.
            <br>

        Modi has raised his profile as a global leader in recent years during official visits with Donald Trump and Xi Jinping.
            <br>
        He has also emerged as a key figure in the international effort to tackle climate change, as warming affects millions of his country's rural citizens.

        Mark Zuckerberg has given the reason for us to use Facebook for professional and personal needs. He is a founder of this social media platform and considering a life now without Facebook is an impossible task. The birth of Facebook was the result of a vision that was planned years ago and in 2004, he started Facebook to keep track of his classmates’ database with names and photos.
        <br><br>
        Considering the brisk business that the platform is generation has made him one of the richest people globally with a net worth of $62.8 billion. Many business tycoons should learn from his noble acts, considering the whopping amount of $45 billion (which was a total of 99% Facebook share) he gave to charity. That’s the stature of a personality who has a ‘heart’ for the downtrodden and ‘less fortunate’.
